## üßê SQL Analysis

Advanced SQL queries were written to deeply explore the HR dataset.  
The analysis includes calculating departmental salary trends, performance vs satisfaction ratings, identifying overtime patterns, promotions over the years, and employee segmentation based on experience.  
Queries range from simple aggregations to complex window functions and conditional logic, ensuring a rich, data-driven foundation for visualization.
